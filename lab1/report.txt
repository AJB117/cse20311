prog3 is supposed to find the distance between two points on a plane given each point's x and y coordinates. The program
is structured by first creating variables for the coordinates of each point, calculate the differences between their x and y 
coordinates, and finally calculating the distance to print. The calculations are done later in the final steps of the program before the
distance is finally printed. Functions pow() and sqrt() were used in these last steps which are from the cmath header file.

To test the program for correctness, I tried testing combinations of positive and negative coordinates. I also tested cases
for 0-valued coordinates and for cases where the coordinates are the same. I tested cases where the coordinates are integers
or floats. To make sure the program's output was correct, I used an online distance formula calculator.

The program failed when using non-numeric characters like "f" or "adfaf", and it also failed when given fractions written like
"3/4" for example. The program would just fall through the first step in entering coordinates, prompting nothing for the 
coordinates of the second point. The distance returned was always 0. I think the program fails in these cases because all
variables are initialized as floats which do not accept strings or chars.
