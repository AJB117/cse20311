Writeup: mysayings.cpp

From a user's perspective, mysayings.cpp works by continuously asking for a choice (an integer 1-5) that corresponds to a certain operation on sayings or the sayings
text file. Users begin the program by selecting a startup file (startup.txt is recommended if there the user has no startup file in mind) whose sayings are loaded
into the text file. Users can then display, add, and save sayings as well as search for sayings that contain a certain substring. 

Internally, the program is split up into functions to help the overall program's readability. startup(), menu(), and prompt() all cover initial and repetitive aspects
of the program whereas display(), newSaying(), findString(), and saveSayings() all handle features of the program. For file i/o, iostream's ifstream and ofstream
were used.

To verify that the output of the program was correct, I tried every option with strings of varying length as well as saving to different save files and loading the contents
of those files into the program on startup multiple times. No unexpected or unwanted behavior occurred.
