Writeup: menucalc.cpp

From a user's perspective, menucalc.cpp works by continuously asking for a choice (an integer 1-5) that corresponds to a mathematical operation or 
exiting the program. The user inputs two operands and receives an answer before being prompted for a choice once again. The user cannot divide by 0,
and it is assumed that the user is well-behaved and always enters integers.

Internally, the program is split up into functions to help make main() easier to read. All math operations are enclosed in their own functions,
and the repetitive printing portions of the program are put in their own functions as well. The text menu that the user interacts with is repeated
until 5 is entered using a while loop that continues to prompt the user until choice equals 5. 

To verify that the output of the program was correct, I tested positive and negative numbers (both ints and floats) for all operations and verified the results 
using a calculator. I verified each case correponded to its operaor by testing every possible operator. I also tested for division by 0 which resulted in 
prompting the user again for input, which was expected. I tested the persistence of the prompt by testing many operators multiple times in a single run.
